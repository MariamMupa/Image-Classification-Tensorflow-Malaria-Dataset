# Image-Classification-Tensorflow-Malaria-Dataset

TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google for the sole purpose of building and training machine learning models.

One of the datasets under the Tensorflow Image libraries is a malaria dataset which contains 27,558 cell images with equal instances of parasitized and uninfected cells from the thin blood smear slide images of segmented cells.

Using this dataset, I have created a model which is able to classify whether a blood smear is uninfected or parasitized.
